                   href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/first/">Cambridge: First Certificate in
                    English</a> in 2009. Since then, I haven't had much opportunity to practice it and so it became kind
                of rusty ðŸ˜¬. <br/>
                Yet I've tried to recover it by watching series and movies, listening to music and using all my apps and
                OSs in English. <br/>
                <br/>
                I'm currently taking some classes to get more fluent in speaking too. <br/>
                I figured that the best way to give you an idea of how well (or bad) I'm at it was by recording
                myself talking. <br/>
                So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and take advantage of this video to also let you know
                a bit about myself. <br/>
