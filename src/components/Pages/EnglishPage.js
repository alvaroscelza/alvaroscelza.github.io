            <p>
                I received my <ExternalLink link={FCELink} text="Cambridge: First Certificate in English"/> in 2009.
                Since then, I haven't had much opportunity to practice it and so it became kind of rusty ðŸ˜¬. <br/>
                Yet I've tried to recover it by watching series and movies, listening to music and using all my apps and
                OSs in English. <br/>
                <br/>
                I'm currently taking some classes to get more fluent in speaking too. <br/>
                I figured that the best way to give you an idea of how well (or bad) I'm at it was by recording
                myself talking. <br/>
                So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and take advantage of this video to also let you know
                a bit about myself. <br/>
                <br/>
                Feel free to <InternalLink link='/contact' text='give me your opinion and/or feedback'/> about it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Correction: the
                book <ExternalLink link={agileEstimatingAndPlanningLink} text="Agile Estimating and Planning"/> was
                written by Mike Cohn, not Robert C. Martin.
