    <ProjectDescription>
        SkollARS is my personal entrepreneurship, whose main purpose is to allow to teach myself. <br/>
        <br/>
        SkollARS mission is to provide consulting and Software development services to small and medium
        companies or individuals, knowing that this public is often outside the target audience of big Software
        factories. <br/>
        <br/>
        SkollARS vision is to contribute to the technologization of all of Uruguay's economic layers, and
        eventually beyond. <br/>
        <br/>
        Even if SkollARS as it is, was born on september of 2019, I was already developing personal projects
        since before.
