        Ripio started a process to partition the monolithic development team we were. To form small teams in charge of
        specific projects, as a way to "agilize" our work. On June of 2021 I was offered the possibility to lead one of
        this teams, in charge of a new project: OTC. <br/>
        OTC is Ripio's area in charge of our VIP clients, those that operate with large sums of money. <br/>
        The team was assembled soon after, with mi on charge of the development effort.
