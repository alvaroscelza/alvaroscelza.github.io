        Ripio started a process to partition the monolithic development team we were. To form small teams in charge of specific projects, as a way to "agilize" our work. In July 2021 I was assigned as Team Leader of a new development team in charge of the development of Ripio's services focused on VIP clients. OTC is Ripio's area in charge of our VIP clients, those that operate with large sums of money. This new opportunity (and challenge) has given me the chance to put into practice all the concepts and knowledge about engineering methodologies and techniques studied at college and in my personal time.
