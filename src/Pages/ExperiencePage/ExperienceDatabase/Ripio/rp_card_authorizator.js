        Soon after finishing rp-conductor (see below), a similar project appeared, but this time in Spain, with another
        provider. We then had the challenge of replicating most of the features we had already made for the previous
        project. <br/>
        <br/>
        Even though we had that into account while building the previous project (since we already knew that the product
        could eventually be used in several countries with different providers), there were some parts of the Software
        that weren't generic enough. <br/>
        That's why I took the job of not only helping with the construction of the new Software, but also merging those
        products once finished, into a final, 100% generic product that was available not only for the two providers we
        already had, but also for any new similar provider and location of the world.
