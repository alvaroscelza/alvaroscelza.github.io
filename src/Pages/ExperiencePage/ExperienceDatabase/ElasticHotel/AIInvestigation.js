      I asked for the opportunity to learn AI and ML since we use those at Elastic and I was curious about it.
      My boss agreed and I started to work on a project to improve our users reviews, while learning using chatGPT.
      Then I also did lots of courses and research including Kaggle, Google searches and the book
      "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".

      I tried different models, each one more complex than the last, and also did a lot of data cleaning and feature
      engineering. I also learned how to use Google Collab and DataSpell, which are great tools for data science.

      The result was a model that could predict the rating of a review with 74% accuracy (still improving).
      I got the confidence to work on ML projects and developed a passion for it. Deciding to focus my career on it in
      the future.
