    <ExperienceDescription>
        As one of the inaugural Software Engineers at Amoeba AI—an AI-powered data science platform revolutionizing revenue growth for GTM teams through dynamic insights and predictive analytics—I spearheaded the development and maintenance of core financial systems that processed complex multi-channel data to enhance forecasting accuracy and budgeting efficiency.
        <br/>
        <b>Key Contributions:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Architected a scalable Pipes and Filters pattern integrated with AWS Lambda to automate financial file ingestion and processing, reducing latency by 40% and enabling real-time ROI optimization for marketing and finance workflows (built on Amoeba's Pulse engine for continuous intelligence).</li>
            <li>Engineered an early Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, delivering a client-facing AI-driven conversational chat that queried proprietary financial datasets for personalized recommendations, simulations of business hypotheses, and actionable next steps—empowering users without data science expertise to drive revenue growth.</li>
            <li>Collaborated cross-functionally to integrate deep learning models and neural networks, supporting Amoeba's mission to transform static dashboards into adaptive, goal-aligned intelligence for enhanced campaign performance and customer lifecycle management.</li>
        </ul>
        These initiatives directly contributed to client testimonials of improved decision-making and predictive insights, solidifying Amoeba's position as a leader in AI-native revenue operations.
