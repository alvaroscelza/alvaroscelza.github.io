    <ExperienceDescription>
            In parallel to GRP project (see below), the Department of Software Development Services (from spanish
            "Departamento de Servicios de Desarrollo de Software" - SDES), on which GRP department depended, lunched a
            project aimed at connecting all departments depending on SDES. The Design Thinking methodology was chosen
            for this purpose and I was asked to participate due to my knowledge and experience on it.
