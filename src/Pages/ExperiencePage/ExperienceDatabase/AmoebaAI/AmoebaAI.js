        As one of the first Software Engineers at Amoeba AI, I played a key role in developing and maintaining our innovative financial system. Utilized AWS Lambdas and a Pipes and Filters architecture to streamline the processing of financial files. Built a rustic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that provided our clients with an AI-Driven chat specialized in their company's financial information.
