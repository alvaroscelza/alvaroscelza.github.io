        I've taken the leap to pursue my entrepreneurial journey, dedicating myself to personal projects I've envisioned for years but never had the time to explore. Fueled by passion more than profit, I'm using my personal savings to bring these ideas to life. These projects allow me to experiment with cutting-edge technologies, learn at my own pace, and dive into topics that spark my curiosity, all while building something meaningful from the ground up.
