        One of the first customers I got for SkollARS needed a webpage for his business, a mortuary. This client wished
        to have a website where to manage his providers, customers and products, besides of being able to offer
        information of the last. <br/>
        <br/>
        He used his own server for hosting.

export {mortuaryTechnologies, mortuaryDescription};
