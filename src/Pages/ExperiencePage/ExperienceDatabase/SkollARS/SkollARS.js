    <ExperienceDescription>
        SkollARS is my personal entrepreneurship, through which I offer my services as a Software Systems Engineer to other companies, by working as a Contractor. <br/>
        SkollARS began as a personal "laboratory" I used to try and practice new techs while also helping small business get software at low price. As such, it has it's own cultural profile:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        SkollARS's mission is to provide software consulting and development services to small and medium-sized companies, in addition to anyone who
        requires these services but remains outside of the target audience of large Software Factories.
        <br/>
        SkollARS's vision is the technologizing of all the economic layers of Uruguay, and eventually beyond.
        <br/>
        SkollARS values are based on honesty, responsibility and true connection with clients. The idea was always to live their business as own,
        in order to be able to truly design-for-improving it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Even if SkollARS as it is, was born on september of 2019, I was already developing personal projects
        since before.
