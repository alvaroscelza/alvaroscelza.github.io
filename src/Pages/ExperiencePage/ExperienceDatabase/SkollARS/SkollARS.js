        SkollARS is my personal entrepreneurship, through which I offer my services as a Software Systems Engineer to other companies, by working as a Contractor. SkollARS began as a personal "laboratory" I used to try and practice new techs while also helping small business get software at low price. As such, it has it's own cultural profile: SkollARS's mission is to provide software consulting and development services to small and medium-sized companies, in addition to anyone who requires these services but remains outside of the target audience of large Software Factories. SkollARS's vision is the technologizing of all the economic layers of Uruguay, and eventually beyond. SkollARS values are based on honesty, responsibility and true connection with clients. The idea was always to live their business as own, in order to be able to truly design-for-improving it. Even if SkollARS as it is, was born on september of 2019, I was already developing personal projects since before.
