    <ExperienceDescription>
        Founded SkollARS in September 2019 as a personal innovation lab to experiment with emerging technologies while delivering affordable, high-impact software solutions to small businesses underserved by large development firms. Evolved into a full-fledged contracting practice, I now serve as a Software Systems Engineer for companies worldwide, leading end-to-end product lifecycles—from ideation and architecture to deployment and iteration. Fully self-funded and client-driven, I treat every project as my own to design solutions that genuinely improve operations.
