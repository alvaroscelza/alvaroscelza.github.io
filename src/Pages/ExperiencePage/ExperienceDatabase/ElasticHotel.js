    <ExperienceDescription>
        As a core Software Engineer at Elastic Hotel—a leading revenue management platform for European hotels, powering dynamic pricing, demand optimization, and analytics via AI-driven tools like Kondo OS—I collaborated with a compact team of two fellow developers to build and scale systems that have generated over €263M in client revenue, enabling hoteliers to focus on guest experiences through automated forecasting and performance insights.

        <b>Key Contributions:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed and led the migration from Flask to Django for our monolithic application, adopting a Django-React architecture to enhance modularity; optimized the CI/CD pipeline using Terraform and AWS, resulting in a 30% faster feature deployment cycle and improved scalability for handling high-volume hospitality data.</li>
            <li>Developed an AI/ML model for user review analysis, achieving 86% accuracy in rating predictions and integrating it into the analytics suite to inform revenue strategies—igniting my expertise in machine learning, which I've since applied to additional models for data normalization and demand forecasting.</li>
            <li>Contributed cross-functionally to the core platform, ensuring seamless integration of AI tools with revenue management workflows, directly supporting client outcomes like €1.6M annual revenue uplift for individual properties through precise, data-driven optimizations.</li>
        </ul>
