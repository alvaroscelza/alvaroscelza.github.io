        I received my
        <a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/first/">Cambridge: First Certificate in English</a> in
        2009. Since then, I haven't had much opportunity to practice it and so it became kind of rusty ðŸ˜¬. <br>
        Yet I've tried to recover it by watching series and movies, listening to music and using all my apps and OSs in English. <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently taking some classes to get more fluent in speaking too. <br>
        I figured that the best way to give you an idea of how well (or bad) I'm at it was by recording myself talking. <br>
        So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and take advantage of this video to also let you know about myself
        in it from my career perspective. <br>
        <br>
        Feel free to <a href="/pages/contacto.html">give me your opinion and/or feedback</a> about it.
